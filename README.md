# FlightLeg

22/12/2021

Simple script connecting python and SQL. It uses database flightlegs.csv. Firstly two new columns are calculated and added to the database: flightDuration and flightType.
Then a few questions are answered:
Which plane took most flights?
Which plane spend most time airborne?
Which flight (in division for domestic and international) was longest and which one was shortest?

Script requires numpy to run.
